        <h1>3 ways which help us in improving accessibility of HTML</h1>
        <p>
            Improving the accessibility of HTML involves incorporating practices and techniques that make web content more inclusive for individuals with disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance the accessibility of HTML:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Use Semantic HTML Elements:</b>
                    <ul>
                       <li> Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the structure of a web page. By using these elements appropriately, you can convey information in a way that is understandable to both users and assistive technologies. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use &lt;nav&gt; for navigation menus.</li>
                            <li>Use &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; for header and footer sections.</li>
                            <li>Use &lt;article&gt; for self-contained content, such as blog posts or articles.</li>
                            <li>Use &lt;main&gt; to identify the main content of the document.</li>
                        </ul>
                       </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <b>Provide Text Alternatives for Images:</b> 
                    <ul>
                       <li> Including descriptive text alternatives for images is crucial for users with visual impairments who may rely on screen readers. Use the alt attribute within the <img> element to provide a concise and meaningful description of the image. If an image is decorative and doesn't convey important information, use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate that the image is decorative.
                        
                       </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <b>Implement Keyboard Accessibility:</b> 
                    <ul>
                       <li> Ensure that all interactive elements on your web page can be operated using a keyboard alone. This is essential for users with motor disabilities who may not be able to use a mouse. Test your website's keyboard accessibility by navigating through the site using only the Tab key and ensuring that focus indicators are visible and logical.
                       </li>
                       <li>For interactive elements like buttons and links, use proper HTML elements (&lt;button&gt; and &lt;a&gt;) rather than relying solely on JavaScript click events.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
    </div>
