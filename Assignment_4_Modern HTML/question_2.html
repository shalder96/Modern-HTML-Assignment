        <h2>What are HTML entities?</h2>
        <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters, as well as characters that might not easily be typed or displayed in HTML documents. In HTML, certain characters have a special meaning and are reserved for specific purposes, such as < and > for tags, or & for starting an entity. To include these characters as literal text in an HTML document without causing parsing issues, you use HTML entities.

            HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). The basic syntax is &entity_name; or &#entity_number;. Here are some commonly used HTML entities:</p>
