        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Feature of HTML5</h1>
        <p>HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced a variety of new features and enhancements to improve the structure and presentation of web content. Here are some key features of HTML5:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Semantics:</dt>
            <dd>Introduction of new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt;, etc., which provide a clearer structure to web documents.</dd>
            <dt>2. Multimedia:</dt>
            <dd>Native support for audio and video elements (&lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;), allowing playback without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.</dd>
            <dt>3. Canvas:</dt>
            <dd>The &lt;canvas&gt; element provides a 2D drawing API for rendering graphics, charts, and other visualizations directly within the browser.</dd>
            <dt>4. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</dt>
            <dd>Support for SVG graphics, enabling the use of vector images that can scale without loss of quality.</dd>
            <dt>5. Geolocation:</dt>
            <dd>The Geolocation API allows websites to request the user's geographical location, providing location-based services.</dd>
            <dt>6. Local Storage:</dt>
            <dd>The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs enable web applications to store data locally on the user's device, persisting even after the browser is closed.</dd>
            <dt>7. Web Storage:</dt>
            <dd>Introduction of localStorage and sessionStorage for storing key-value pairs in a more efficient manner than cookies.</dd>
            <dt>8. Drag and Drop:</dt>
            <dd>Native support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to implement intuitive user interfaces.</dd>
            <dt>9. Accessibility:</dt>
            <dd>Improvements in accessibility features, including native support for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, helping developers create more accessible web content.</dd>
            <dt>10. Responsive Design:</dt>
            <dd>HTML5 includes features like the &lt;meta name="viewport"&gt; tag and media queries to facilitate the creation of responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</dd>

        </dl>
        <p>These features collectively contribute to a more dynamic, interactive, and multimedia-rich web experience. It's important to note that HTML5 is continually evolving, and additional features may be introduced over time.</p>
